NP is the class of all search problems (classic definition limits NP to yes-no problems).
P is the class of search problems solvable in poly-time (classic definition limits P to yes-no problems).

Nondeterministic machine can guess the desired solution.
NP: search problems solvable in poly-time on a nondeterministic Turing machine

Extended Church-Turing thesis:
P = search problems solvable in poly-time in the natural world
