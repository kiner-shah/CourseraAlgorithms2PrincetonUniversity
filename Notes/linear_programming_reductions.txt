Reduce from non-standard form to standard form
Minimization problem: replace min 13A + 15B with max - 13A - 15B
>= constraints: replace 4A + 4B >= 160 with 4A + 4B - S = 160, S >= 0
Unrestricted variables: replace B with B = B0 - B1, B0,B1 >= 0

Linear "programming" (1950s term) = reduction to LP (modern term)
	- Process of formulating an LP model for a problem
	- Solution to LP for a specific problem gives solution to the problem
1. Identify variables
2. Define constraints (inequalities and equations)
3. Define objective function
4. Convert to standard form (software usually performs this step automatically)

Modelling the maxflow problem as a linear program
Variables: xvw = flow on edge v->w
Constraints: capacity and flow conservation
Objective function: net flow into t

Maximum cardinality bipartite matching problem
LP formulation: one variables per pair
Interpretation: xij = 1, if person i assigned to job j
Theorem (Birkoff 1946, von Neumann 1953): all extreme points of the above polyhedron have integer (0 or 1) coordinates
Corollary: can solve matching problem by solving LP (not usually so lucky)

Got an optimization problem?
Approach 1: Use a specialized algorithm to solve it
- Algorithms 4/e book
- Vast literature on algorithms
Approach 2: Use linear programming
- Many problems are easily modelled as LPs
- Commercial solvers can solve those LPs
- Might be slower than specialized solution (but you might not care)
