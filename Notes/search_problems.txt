Four fundamental problems:
LSOLVE: given a system of linear equations, find a solution
LP: given a system of linear inequalities, find a solution
ILP: given a system of linear inequalities, find a 0-1 solution
SAT: given a system of boolean equations, find a binary solution

Which of these problems have poly-time algorithms?
LSOLVE: Yes, Gaussian elimination solves N by N system in N^3 time
LP: Yes. Ellipsoid algorithm is poly-time (but was open problem for decades)
ILP, SAT: No poly-time algorithm known or believed to exist (but we still don't know for sure)

Search problem: given an instance I of a problem, find a solution S or report doesn't exists
Requirement: must be able to efficiently check that S is a solution.

FACTOR: given a n-bit integer, find a nontrivial factor
