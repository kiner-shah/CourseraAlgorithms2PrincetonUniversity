Desiderata: classify problems according to computational requirements
Frustrating news: huge number of problems have defied classification

Definition: problem X reduces to problem Y if you can use an algorithm that solves Y to help solve X

Cost of solving X = total cost of solving Y (perhaps many calls to Y on problems of different sizes) + cost of reduction (preprocessing and postprocessing)

Example 1: finding the median reduces to sorting
To find the median of N terms:
	1. Sort N items
	2. Return item in the middle
Cost: NlogN (cost of sorting) + 1 (cost of reduction)

Example 2: element distinctness reduces to sorting
	1. Sort N items
	2. Check adjacent pairs for equality
Cost: NlogN + N
