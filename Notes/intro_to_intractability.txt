Questions about computation:
What is a general purpose computer?
Are there limits on the power of digital computers?
Are there limits on the power of machines we can build?

A simple model of computation: DFAs
Tape:
- stores input
- one arbitrarily long strip, divided into cells
- finite alphabet of symbols

Tape head:
- points to one cell of tape
- read a symbol from active cell
- moves one cell at a time

Is there a more powerful model of computation? Yes.

A universal model of computation: Turing machines
Tape:
- stores input, output and intermediate results
- one arbitrarily long strip, divided into cells
- finite alphabet of symbols

Tape head:
- points to one cell of tape
- reads a symbol from active cell
- writes a symbol to active cell
- moves one cell at a time

Is there a more powerful model of computation? No (most important scientific result of 20th century)

Church-Turing thesis (1936): Turing machines can compute any function that can be computed by a physically harnessable process of the natural world.

Remark: "Thesis" and not a mathematical theorem because it's a statement about physical world and not subject to proof (but can be falsified).

Implications:
- No need to seek more powerful machines or languages
- Enables rigorous study of computation (in this universe)

A problem is intractable if it can't be solved in polynomial time.
